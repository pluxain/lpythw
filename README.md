# LPYTHW

This is my repo to go through [lpythw](https://learnpythonthehardway.com)

## Activate

As it seems Python must now have [virtual environments (venvs)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments) in order to install packages, run `. activate` at the root of this repo in order to activate the dedicated venv.

## Jupyter

Once the venv is activated, you can run the jupyter lab by running `jupyter-lab` at the root of this repository.
